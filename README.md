# Professional Training Center Database Project

### Project Title: Database Implementation for TC Professional Training Center

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a database for a company offering professional training in various fields, including IT programming and cybersecurity. The database is designed to manage and store information about trainings, candidates, professors, staff, and other related entities.

## Database Architecture

The database contains a total of 15 tables, including 6 strong entities and 9 weak entities.

### Strong Entities
- **TRAINING**
- **CANDIDATE**
- **PROFESSOR**
- **STAFF**
- **INTERNSHIP**
- **CERTIFICATION_ARCHIVE**

### Weak Entities

- **TRAINING_HOURS**
- **TRAINING_ATTENDANCE**
- **PAYMENT**
- **PAYMENT_METHOD**
- **BANK_INFO**
- **SALARY**
- **QUALIFICATIONS**
- **EVALUATION**

Each table has its attributes and primary keys. The relationships between the strong entities are weak, while the relationships between strong and weak entities are strong.

## Database Normalization
